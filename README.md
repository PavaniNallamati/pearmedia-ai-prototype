# Pear Media AI Prototype 🚀

## 📌 Overview

This project is a web-based AI application that processes both **text and image inputs** to generate enhanced prompts and AI-generated images.

It demonstrates the integration of multiple AI APIs for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computer Vision workflows**.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* React.js
* Tailwind CSS
* OpenAI API (Text Enhancement & Image Generation)
* Google Gemini API (Image Analysis)

---

## ✨ Features

### 🟣 Text Workflow

* User enters a simple prompt
* AI enhances the prompt using NLP
* User can edit and approve the enhanced prompt
* AI generates an image based on the final prompt

---

### 🔵 Image Workflow

* User uploads an image
* AI analyzes:

  * Objects
  * Style
  * Colors
* AI generates variations based on analysis
